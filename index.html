        There was a time in which looking for inspiration and advice for travelers was harder. The only possible source was buying travel guides, and they had to spend a lot of money to get them.

        Every time they had to plan a trip, they had to buy a guide about the country they were going to visit. But today, thanks to Internet, everything is easier, and of course, even planning a trip.
        
        Today you don’t have to buy a different guide every time you want to travel, you just type on your computer what you are looking for and you get your answers immediately. And this is thanks to travel blogs.
